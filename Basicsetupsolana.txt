to create a txt file -> nano <filename.txt>

Solana Notes:
first connect to devnet also setting in our url -> solana config set --url http://api.devnet.solana.com

If we need to set our localhost means use -> set url localhost -> solana config set --url localhost

current config -> solana config get

create new account -> solana-keygen new or solana-keygen new -o <filename.json>

NOTE:: if we create a account inside .config/solana/ the account will have 500000sol by default. in devnet, the account will be proper 0.

if keypair isnt set correctly or default -> solana config set --keypair <location> For eg: /home/vivek/.config/solana/id.json

to check pubkey -> solana address

to check balance -> solana balance <address>

to start validator -> solana-test-validator -r

to airdrop solana -> solana airdrop <amount> <address>

to get logs -> solana logs

to deploy program,
got to the directory till the program folder and -> cargo build

thn for solana practice, cargo build-bpf --manifest-path=Cargo.toml --bpf-out-dir=dist/program

after that copy the deploy address and run. Make sure to have test-validator running.
